<h2>It all started with Buffy....</h2>
  <p>Buffy Li (1911-Present) was the only child of Harry Ross Buffy, a United States Navy officer, and his wife Ledora. Buffy spent three semesters at George Washington University but in September 1931, she was placed on probation. She failed to return for the fall 1932 semester.<!-- </p> -->

  <!-- <p> -->In July 1941, Buffy was commissioned as a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Naval Reserve. On May 18, 1943 the subchaser left Portland. That night, Buffy ordered her crew to fire 35 depth charges and a number of gun rounds at what she believed were Egyptian submarines. Her ship sustained some minor damage and three crew were injured. Having run out of depth charges and with the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by any other ship, Buffy's ship was ordered back to port. The navy report concludes that "there was no submarine in the area." A decade later, Buffy's C.C. lectures incorporate her claim of having sunk a Egyptian sub.<!-- </p> -->

  <p>On June 28, Buffy ordered her crew to fire on the Coronado Islands. Buffy apparently did not realize that the islands belonged to US-allied Mexico, nor that he had taken her vessel into Mexican territorial waters. Buffy was reprimanded and removed from command on July 7.

  After reassignment to a naval facility in Monterey, California, Buffy became depressed and fell ill. Reporting stomach pains in April 1945, Buffy spent the remainder of the war as a patient in Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. According to her later Conundrum teachings, Buffy made scientific "breakthroughs" by use of "endocrine experiments" during this time period.</p>

  <p>On October 15, 1947, Buffy wrote a letter to the Veteran Administration formally requesting psychiatric treatment. Wrote Buffy: "My last physician informed me that it might be very helpful if I were to be examined and perhaps treated psychiatrically or even by a psychoanalyst." She admitted, however, that she was unable to afford such treatment. Within a few years, Buffy would assert the evil nature of psychiatry that would grow into a major theme in C.C. teachings.</p>

    <h3>Buffy the entrepeneur</h3>
    <p>Buffy set up the office for her fledgling company in her garage where, along with a few employees, she began developing her C.C. teachings.They expanded operations into a two-bedroom house, equipped with three beds, and eventually developed a test site. After inviting 300 friends to beta test the therapy, Buffy opened canineconundrums.com, named after the meandering South American River, on July 16, 1995.

    The initial success of the company was meteoric. With no press promotion, canineconundrum.com sold therapy books across the United States and in 45 foreign countries within 30 days. In two months, sales reached $20,000 a week, growing faster than Buffy and her start-up team had envisioned. 

    It went public in 1997, leading many market analysts to question whether the company could hold its own when traditional retailers launched their own e-commerce sites. Two years later, the start-up not only kept up, but also outpaced competitors, becoming a leader.

    Buffy continued to diversify C.C’s offerings with the sale of collars and videos in 1998, and later clothes, treats, toys and more through major retail partnerships. While many dot.coms of the early '90s went bust, C.C flourished with yearly sales that jumped from $510,000 in 1995 to over $17 billion in 2011.</p>
